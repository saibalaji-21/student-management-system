# Student Management System

## Overview

The **Student Management System** is a Java-based console application designed to manage student records efficiently. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding, removing, updating, and searching for students. Additionally, it provides features like sorting, filtering, and generating performance summaries. This system is ideal for educational institutions or anyone needing to manage student data in a structured manner.

## Input Validation

The system ensures all inputs are valid:
- **Name**: Only letters and spaces.
- **ID**: Unique positive integer.
- **Age**: Valid age between 0 and 100.
- **GPA**: Valid GPA between 0.0 and 4.0.
- **Year**: Must be one of `First`, `Second`, `Third`, or `Fourth`.
- **Department**: Must be one of `CS`, `IS`, `AI`, `IT`, or `DS`.

## Code Structure

### Classes
1. **`Student`**:
    - Represents a student with attributes: `name`, `ID`, `age`, `GPA`, `year`, and `department`.

2. **`StudentSystem`**:
    - Manages a list of students and provides methods for adding, removing, updating, searching, sorting, filtering, and generating summaries.

### Methods
- **Input Validation**:
    - `inputValidName`, `inputValidID`, `inputValidAge`, `inputValidGPA`, `inputValidYear`, `inputValidDepartment`, `inputValidChoice`.
- **Student Operations**:
    - `addStudent`, `removeStudentByID`, `updateStudentByID`, `searchByID`, `listAndSortAllStudents`, `filterByAge`, `filterByGPA`, `filterByYear`, `filterByDepartment`, `countTotalStudents`, `calculateAverageGPA`, `displayTop5`, `displayFailingStudents`, `countStudentsByYear`, `generateSummary`.
